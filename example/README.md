# Shopping Cart Feature - HSIS Example Project

> This is an example project demonstrating the Hierarchical Specialized Intelligence Swarm (HSIS) workflow.

## Overview

This project showcases the artifacts generated by the HSIS workflow for implementing a shopping cart feature in an e-commerce application.

## HSIS Workflow Status

| Phase | Agent | Status | Artifacts |
|-------|-------|--------|-----------|
| PM (Requirements) | Gemini CLI | ✅ Complete | [PRD.md](docs/PRD.md) |
| Architect (Design) | Codex CLI | ✅ Complete | [ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md), [IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md](docs/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md), [ADR-001](adrs/ADR-001.md) |
| Developer (Implementation) | Claude Code CLI | ⏳ Ready | Awaiting implementation |

## Artifacts Overview

### 1. Intake Requirement
The initial requirement from stakeholders requesting a shopping cart feature.

**Key Points:**
- Add products to cart
- Persistent cart for logged-in users
- Performance requirements (<500ms operations)

### 2. PRD (Product Manager Output)
Comprehensive requirements document with:
- 8 Functional Requirements (FR-001 to FR-008)
- 6 Non-Functional Requirements (NFR-001 to NFR-006)
- 25+ Acceptance Criteria
- Release plan (MVP, V1.0, V2.0)

### 3. Architecture Specification (Architect Output)
Technical design including:
- System architecture diagram
- Data models (Cart, CartItem, PromoCode)
- API contracts (6 endpoints)
- Security model
- Performance budget

### 4. Implementation Plan (Architect Output)
Work breakdown with:
- 32 tasks across 6 phases
- Dependency graph
- Test plan linkage
- Risk mitigations

### 5. ADR-001 (Architect Output)
Architecture decision record documenting the choice of Redis for caching.

## Running the Implementation Phase

To implement this project with Claude Code CLI:

```bash
# Navigate to example directory
cd example

# Run Claude Code CLI with implementation prompt
claude "Implement the shopping cart feature according to ARCHITECTURE.md and IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md. Follow CLAUDE.md constraints strictly. Start with T-001 and proceed through all tasks in order."
```

## Traceability

All requirements trace through the workflow:

| Requirement | Architecture Element | Test |
|-------------|---------------------|------|
| FR-001 | POST /cart/items, CartService.addItem | add-item.test.ts |
| FR-002 | GET /cart, CartPage | view-cart.test.ts |
| NFR-001 | Redis cache, optimized queries | cart-operations.test.ts |
