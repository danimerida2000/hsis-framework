# Shopping Cart Feature Request

## Overview
We need to add a shopping cart feature to our e-commerce platform. This is a critical feature for our Q1 launch.

## Business Context
- Current state: Users can browse products but cannot save items for purchase
- Target users: Online shoppers, particularly mobile users
- Competitive pressure: All competitors have cart functionality

## Requirements (High Level)
1. Users should be able to add products to a cart
2. Users should be able to view their cart
3. Users should be able to modify quantities
4. Users should be able to remove items
5. Cart should persist across sessions (for logged-in users)
6. Cart should show running total with taxes

## Constraints
- Must integrate with existing product catalog API
- Must work on mobile (responsive design)
- Performance: Cart operations should be fast (<500ms)
- Security: Cart data must be secure

## Timeline
- MVP needed by end of Q1
- Full feature set by Q2

## Stakeholders
- Product Owner: Jane Smith
- Engineering Lead: John Doe
- Design Lead: Alice Johnson

## Open Questions
- Should we support guest checkout?
- What about wishlists?
- International shipping considerations?
